What are _Code smells_
- a kind of technical debt (what's that) [video](assets/images/techdebt_small.mp4){:target="_present"}
- develop a nose for bad smelling code

## 10:00 Refactoring

What is _Refactoring_

> A change made to the internal structure of software 
> to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify 
> without changing its observable behaviour. 
> â€” Refactoring, Martin Fowler, page 53.

note:  non-functional changes are behaviour

Create a common language of how to manipulate code as a structure, rather than text.

## 10:15 Break

## 10:30 Exercise: Refactoring 1

[Smells](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells){:target="_present"}:
- Speculative Generality

[Exercise: Vehicles](https://pete-the-programmer.com/tdd-ex-refactor1/){:target="_present"}

Focus on:
- making the bus and ferry the __same__ with _rename_ and _extract method_/_inline_
- _pull up_

Do it once. If we have time, demo it and then do it as a class again.

## 11:00 Exercise: Refactoring 2


[Smells](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells){:target="_present"}:
- Primitive Obsession
- Temporary Field

[Exercise: Narrowed change](https://pete-the-programmer.com/tdd-ex-refactor2/){:target="_present"}

Narrowed change and scaffolding
