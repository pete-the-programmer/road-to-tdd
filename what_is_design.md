- Drawing pictures
- Writing prose
- Talking to the customer about their needs and problems
- Building a prototype/proof-of-concept
- Coding a "baby" solution
- Writing code to exercise some new technology
- Whole-team reviews of design decisions
- Sketching wireframes/screenshots
- Creating a requirements document
- Studying a requirements document
- Creating detailed architectural documents
- Designing the full database schema
- Preparing a two-page summary architecture document
- Creating use cases
- Using CRC cards to explain something
- Using the whiteboard to explain something
- Asking a colleague why something was done a certain way
- Explaining a problem to your (disinterested, but patient) spouse
